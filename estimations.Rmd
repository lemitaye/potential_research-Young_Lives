```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Preliminaries:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())

# packages
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(scales)
library(stargazer)
library(AER)

theme_set(theme_light())
```


Need to run data cleaning first
```{r raw_data, cache=TRUE}
source("scripts/extract_clean.R")
```

## OLS and IV on all sample

Start by estimating a simple model for both OLS and IV

First stage regression (no covariates): 
```{r chunk_1}
sfrst <- lm(IMTI ~ E_is, data = joined)
stargazer(sfrst, type = "text")
```

2SLS on the whole sample:

```{r}
smod_ols <- lm(wage_employ ~ IMTI, data = joined)
smod_iv <- ivreg(wage_employ ~ IMTI | E_is, data = joined)
stargazer(smod_ols, smod_iv, type = "text")
```
